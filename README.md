*Game compatibility is dependent on webЯcade emulator support. See a list of available systems [here](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/emulators/).
The easiest method to import games is to use the Drag and Drop feature with content found on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). See the documentation [here](https://docs.webrcade.com/editor/draganddrop/) for more information.
